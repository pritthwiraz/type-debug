                    </h3>
                    <p class="card-text">There are two main types of browser storages Local storage and Session storage.
                        They both have their own unique benefits and drawbacks. We will look into the
                        differences of local storage and session storage.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Local Storage</h4>
                    <p>The localStorage object allows you to save key/value pairs in the browser.</p>
                    <p>The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date.</p>
                    <p>The data is not deleted when the browser is closed, and are available for future
                        sessions.</p>
                    <h4>Session Storage</h4>
                    <p>The sessionStorage object let you store key/value pairs in the browser.</p>
                    <p>The sessionStorage object stores data for only one session.</p>
                    <p>The data is deleted when the browser is closed.</p>

                    </h3>
                    <p class="card-text">In JavaScript, there are 3 types of variable scope, namely 1) Global Scope 2)
                        Function Scope 3) Block Scope.
                        Although, there used to be only two types of scopes before ES6, the global scope, and the local
                        scope. But, with ES6 local scope was broken down into function scope and block scope. Let's
                        explore the difference between global scope and block scope.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Global Scope</h4>
                    <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and
                        have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                        program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Block Scope</h4>
                    <p>Block scope is a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                        variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or
                        conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from
                        within the curly brackets {}.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title  text-center">How does event loop works in JavaScript?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="card-text">JavaScript is a single-threaded language. In other words, it can do only one
                        thing at a time.
                        JavaScript executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures,
                        gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s
                        asynchronous programming.</p>
                    <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                        Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the
                        Call Stack, which effectively runs it.</p>
                    <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before
                        pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop
                        triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to
                        the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.
                    </p>
